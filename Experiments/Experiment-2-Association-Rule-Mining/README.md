Experiment 2 – Association Rule Mining
===

In the Association Rule Mining approach was chosen Apriori algorithm because
of its ability to identify a set of underlying rules that collectively represent
knowledge within input data. The NLP approach used in the experiment greatly
facilitated the process of data preprocessing. This approach was able to extract
business rules for a given business question but required preprocessing the data
into the required transaction dataset. The complexity of data preprocessing for
Association Mining algorithms may be one of the reasons why data quality
tools do not widely support this approach. This approach seems challenging to automate. 
The similar alternative approach to the performed experiment is the
manual definition of business rules which is entirely dependent on the skills of
a domain expert. Detail information about experiment can be found in the Master's thesis (3.3.2 Experiment 2 – Association Rule Mining).
