  abstract    = {concepts are the basic units of theory development and the building blocks of social research, this is because without well-developed conceptual definitions for the research terms, it is impossible to develop a coherent theory, moreover, it is impossible to develop a valid measure of a concept that is not precisely defined, It should be noted, however, the importance of defining concepts differs depending on the adopted research approach. In the quantitative approach, the concepts are clarified and connected to empirical indicators which will be used to operationalize these concepts before the research begins, while in qualitative research concepts remain under construction during the research not only in the operational terms, but also in theoretical terms. Given the importance of defining the study concepts, this paper evaluated the available definitions of the concept quality in order to find or propose a valid and reliable definition of quality.},
