High-quality data is crucial for trusted data-based decisions. A considerable part of current data quality measuring approaches is associated with expensive, expert and time-consuming work that includes manual effort to achieve adequate results. Furthermore, these approaches are prone to error and do not take full advantage of the AI potential. A possible solution is to explore ML-based state-of-the-art methods that are using the potential of AI to overcome these issues.\\
\hspace*{5mm} A significant part of the thesis deals with data quality theory which provides a comprehensive insight into the field of data quality. Four ML-based state-of-the-art methods were discovered in the existing literature, and one novel method based on Autoencoders (AE) was proposed.\\
\hspace*{5mm} Experiments with AE and Association Rule Mining using NLP were conducted. Proposed methods based on AE proved to detect potential data quality defects in real-world datasets. Association Rule Mining approach was able to extract business rules for a given business question, but the required significant preprocessing effort. Alternative non-AI methods were also analyzed but required reliance on expert and domain knowledge.
