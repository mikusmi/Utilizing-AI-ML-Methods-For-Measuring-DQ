ASSIGNMENT OF MASTERâ€™S THESIS
---

Traditional data quality measurement methods need significant manual effort and domain expert experience. Apart from being a time-consuming process, these traditional methods are often based on manual definition of rules or thresholds and are therefore subject to human error. Utilization of AI/ML methods offers an alternative data-driven approach that might overcome some of the drawbacks of traditional methods.

* Describe key aspects of data quality and review the state-of-the-art methods for monitoring and measuring data quality with special emphasis on AI/ML based approaches.
* Experimentally compare traditional (non-AI) methods for measuring data quality with methods using AI/ML techniques.
* Propose directions for further improvements in the application of AI/ML in data quality.

Abstract of the Thesis
---

High-quality data is crucial for trusted data-based decisions. A considerable
part of current data quality measuring approaches is associated with expensive,
expert and time-consuming work that includes manual effort to achieve
adequate results. Furthermore, these approaches are prone to error and do not
take full advantage of the AI potential. A possible solution is to explore MLbased
state-of-the-art methods that are using the potential of AI to overcome
these issues.
A significant part of the thesis deals with data quality theory which provides
a comprehensive insight into the field of data quality. Four ML-based stateof-
the-art methods were discovered in the existing literature, and one novel
method based on Autoencoders (AE) was proposed.
Experiments with AE and Association Rule Mining using NLP were
conducted. Proposed methods based on AE proved to detect potential data
quality defects in real-world datasets. Association Rule Mining approach
was able to extract business rules for a given business question, but the
required significant preprocessing effort. Alternative non-AI methods were
also analyzed but required reliance on expert and domain knowledge.
